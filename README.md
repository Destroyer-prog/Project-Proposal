# Project Proposal
Project Name: Shape Area Calculator

Name: Christian Ruiz

(No team name)

This project will build a Java program where it features a base class called Shape with a method called calculateArea() that calculates the area of every shape. 

To do that, four classes have to be created; Rectangle, square, triangle, and circle.

Each class will include different attributes such as base, length, height, radius, etc.

The calculateArea() method will return each shape's area.

The area will be converted into a double and rounded by two decimal places.
